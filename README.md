# NixOS config by jakublaba

## Installation
> [!WARNING] \
> Before building, `hardware-config.nix` in chosen host with the one that was generated by you in `/etc/nixos/hardware-config.nix`. Otherwise you can brick your system.

### Get a fresh hardware scan.
```
sudo nixos-generate-config
```
You will get a warning like this
```
warning: not overwriting existing /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
```
But we only care about `hardware-configuration.nix` here.

### Overwrite `hardware-config.nix` from this repo with your own
```
sudo cp /etc/nixos/hardware-config.nix ./hosts/[pc|vm]/hardware-configuration.nix
```

### Build
```
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#[pc|vm]
```
